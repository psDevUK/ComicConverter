# ComicConverter
The one and only comic converter for Powershell

# What Is It?
So this is a Powershell conversion of https://github.com/caraplana1/ComicConverter with each of the 4 methods added from that C# library into CMDLETS

# Why Do It?
Well I wanted to up-my-game in Powershell, and although I have published a good amount of modules to the Powershell Gallery, none have been pure binary modules. It did interest me about making these modules. My biggest thing outside of work and family is comic books. I love reading them. I have a good amount of digital comics I own, so when I saw this comic book converter I thought I want that as a Powershell Module. So this is the why.

# What Does It Do?
 This module include 4 cmdlets that allow you to do various conversions with the digital comics you have. For instance you could have a comic in a PDF format, but would prefer that in a CBZ format. Also the opposite, you have the ability to convert CBR comics to PDF comics. You can also extract all the images from a comic to a specific folder.  Finally you can create your own CBR from an array of images.
